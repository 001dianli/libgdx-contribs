libgdx-contribs
===============

My contributions and utilities for the awesome libgdx game development framework.

Project files and instructions are for Eclipse 3.7.2 (Indigo) or higher, but others may work as well with some adaptation.

## post-processing ##

A lightweight library to ease development and inclusion of post-processing effects in libgdx applications and games.


### Cloning and importing the projects in Eclipse ###

You should be able to start using the post-processor and its bundled effects in a few minutes, start by cloning the *libgdx-contribs* project in your preferred directory:

    https://github.com/manuelbua/libgdx-contribs.git

Then you need to import two projects, **libgdx-contribs-utils** and **libgdx-contribs-postprocessing**.

In Eclipse, *File->Import* and point it to the *utils* folder, accept the defaults or change to your likings and import the project, then do the same with the *postprocessing* folder.
At this point you should have both projects built, if *Build automatically* has been setup in your workspace, else build them manually.

*__Congrats!__ You can now start add some postprocessing eyecandy to your project, or continue reading if you want to try out the bundled demo application.*

### Demo application ###

You may want to explore some of the bundled effects to get a taste of what the library can do and if its good for your own projects: there is a demo project inside the *postprocessing* folder, just *File->Import* again and point it to the `postprocessing/demo` folder to import it into your workspace.

Too lazy to try it now? See it in action on [YouTube](http://youtu.be/TNMwUKiR5fY)!
