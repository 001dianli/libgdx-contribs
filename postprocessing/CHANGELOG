	* postprocessing/mk-changelog.sh: Makes sure to generate the
	changelog for the master branch.

	* postprocessing/mk-changelog.sh: Add CHANGELOG script facility.

	Should be quite manageable and very simple to use: just specify a
	git log expression such as "v1.0.0..v1.0.1" to generate it, if
	expression is omitted then a full log will be generated (required
	git2cl!).  It will also try to filter out mail address and transform the "[at]"
	(at) sign to an "[at]" string, not sure how many spammers this thing
	will fool btw :P

	* postprocessing/README.md: Disambiguate "link" with "soft-link".

	I meant linux's soft-linking and not Eclipse resource linking, that
	will probably not work AFAIK.

	* postprocessing/README.md: Updated documentation, fixed missing
	ShaderLoader configuration.
